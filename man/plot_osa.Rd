\title{Plot OSA residuals for one for more fleets}
\usage{
plot_osa(res, outpath = NULL, figheight = 8, figwidth = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{output from \code{\link{run_osa}}, a long-format dataframe with
the following columns: fleet, index_label (indicates whether the comp is
age or length), year, index (age or length bin), resid (osa)}

\item{outpath}{(default=NULL) directory to save figures to (e.g., "figs")}

\item{figheight}{(default=8 in) figure height in inches, user may want to increase
if they have a large number of ages or lengths}

\item{figwidth}{(default=NULL) by default the function scales the figure width by
the number of fleets being plotted. user may want to overwrite depending on
other variables like the number of years in the model.}
}
\value{
saves a multipanel figure with OSA bubble plots, standard normal QQ plots,
  and aggregated fits to the composition data for one or more fleets, also
  returns these plots as an outputted list for further refinement by user if
  needed.
